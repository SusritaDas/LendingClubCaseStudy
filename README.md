# Lending Club Case Study

## Business purpose
-  This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
##### We perform some analysis to identify the 'risky applicants who could be defaulters so that the company can utilise the data for their benefits

## Process followed
##### For this analysis we have done the following :
-  We used python as our coding language
-  We loaded the loan data loan.csv
-  We modified  and cleaned the data like null removal, removal of unwanted columns, character conversions etc so that its easy to use
-  We did some univariate analysis
-  We did some bivariate/multivariate analysis
-  We use histplot, countplot, scatterplot, subplot,set_palette graphs for the analysis
-  We derived some conclusions or observations

## Results derived

##### Analysis considering charged off loans for other important columns :
-  Persons who receive interest at the rate of 11-16% are likely to default
-  Persons whose home ownership as 'RENT' or 'MORTGAGE' are likely to default
-  Persons who have taken loan for purpose debt_cosolidation are likely to default
-  When the no of enquiries in last 6 months is 0 are likely to default
